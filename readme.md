* **Youtube mp3 Batch Downloader**

I have been thinking about writing scripts to automate my regular tasks and I realized that I often find myself using third-party sites and sometimes manually converting videos to mp3 so I took up the task of writing a script of downloading batches of mp3 audio of youtube videos using their links. I use the functions of python module `youtube_dl` in this script.
